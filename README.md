DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED:
This program implements a basic arithmetic expression parser and evaluator using recursive descent parsing. It supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses ().

How It Works:
1.Parses and evaluates mathematical expressions from user input.

2.Handles operator precedence (multiplication & division before addition & subtraction).

3.Supports parentheses for grouping operations.

4.Detects syntax errors and prevents division by zero
